## 🧩 Problem Taxonomy

I organize problems by **concept strength**, not just difficulty:

* 🟢 Foundations → Arrays, Strings, Math
* 🔵 Core Structures → Linked List, Stack, Queue
* 🟣 Trees & Graphs → Traversals, BFS/DFS
* 🟡 Advanced Thinking → Dynamic Programming
* 🔴 Pattern Mastery → Greedy, Backtracking
